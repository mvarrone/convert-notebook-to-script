## Convert .ipynb to .py files

### The goal of this repository is to create a Python script able to transform a Jupyter Notebook into a single Python script in order to only have Python code as a result

## Running the script
* Be sure there is, at least, one *.ipynb* file inside **inputs** folder.
* Then, execute the script by using:

    ```bash 
    py .\main.py
    ```
* Finally, check **outputs** folder to see the results

Note: An example is provided in both folders
